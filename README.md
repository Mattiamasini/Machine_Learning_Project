I have used Python to conduct a causal analysis on the relationship between corruption and firm growth in Vietnam, relying heavily on Double Machine Learning frameworks. My data preparation relied on pandas, NumPy, and pyjanitor to transform raw administrative and survey data into a clean, merged panel dataset with regression-ready variables. I implemented complete ML pipelines featuring K-fold cross-validation, train-test splits, and GridSearchCV to fine-tune scikit-learn models (RandomForestRegressor, RandomForestClassifier, and LogisticRegression). These were then fed into DML and CausalForestDML estimators. By evaluating nuisance model performance and variable importance, I was able to reliably estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. The final analysis yielded strong evidence that decreased bribery intensity is associated with higher firm employment, which served as my primary proxy for firm growth.
